This project is created to captures steps invovled in my learning of:
- strapi for APIs (used quickstart option)

- This is based on 7 part [tutorial series](https://strapi.io/blog/cooking-a-deliveroo-clone-with-nuxt-vue-js-graphql-strapi-and-stripe-setup-part-1-7) from strapi
- These steps are performed on Windows 10
